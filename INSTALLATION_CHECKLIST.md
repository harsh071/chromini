**Possible causes:**

- [ ] API flags not enabled in `chrome://flags`
- [ ] Insufficient system resources (disk space, RAM, VRAM)
- [ ] API not available in your region/device

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Chrome version: `chrome://version/`
2. Enable all AI flags in `chrome://flags`
3. Restart Chrome completely
4. Check disk space (need 22GB+)
5. Run this in DevTools Console to debug:
   ```javascript
   if ('Writer' in self) {
     console.log('Writer API exists');
     self.Writer.availability().then(status => {
       console.log('Availability:', status);
     });
   } else {
     console.log('Writer API not found in browser');
   }
   ```

### ‚ùå Context menu doesn't appear

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Verify extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
- [ ] Reload the extension (click reload icon)
- [ ] Refresh the webpage (F5)
- [ ] Make sure text is selected before right-clicking
- [ ] Check browser console (F12) for errors

### ‚ùå Extension loads but nothing happens when clicking menu

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab
- [ ] Look for JavaScript errors
- [ ] Verify content script loaded (should see log message)

- [ ] If stuck >30 minutes, try:
  - Restart Chrome
  - Clear cache: `chrome://settings/clearBrowserData`
  - Reload extension

### ‚ùå Generated content is irrelevant or low quality

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Provide more specific input text

- [ ] Try different task types (email vs cover letter)
- [ ] Remember: AI output is a starting point - edit as needed!

## DevTools Console Checks
